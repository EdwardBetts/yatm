What is Yatm?

Yatm is a simple command line audio player which can perform playback at
a different speed than the original audio was recorded with.

THis is done without changing the sounds pitch.

yatm supports Speex, MPEG audio and all formats supported
by libsndfile (OGG/Vorbis, FLAC, WAV, ...) input files.

Comments are welcome.
